# Mechanical Testing Procedures
1) static load breaking test
   - fix distal end of swab
   - apply static load to bristle-end
   - measure breaking with load
   - ensure breaking occurs at at snap-point, not on bristle shaft or bristle head

2) dynamic load breaking test
   - fix distal end of swab
   - apply static load to bristle-end
   - measure breaking with load
   - ensure breaking occurs at at snap-point, not on bristle shaft or bristle head
   
3) static load bending test 
   - fix distal end of swab
   - apply static load to bristle-end
   - measure bending angel with load
   - ensure swab bends and flexes less than maximum angle
   TODO: *specify maximum angle-per-load constraints* (e.g. 75 degrees and XX Newtons)

4) dynamic load bending test
   TODO: *define this*

# Chemical Testing Procedures
1) test that swab absorbs viral RNA particles
2) test that swab does not interfere with PCA/reagents


# Absorption Testing Procedures
1) quantify amount of absorption
   TODO: *quantify absorption of current swabs and test against current/old standard*
   method #1 with water, narrowest graduated cylinder you can find or tape a ruler/measuring tape to a test tube
   - fill tube with a known volume of water, note initial volume from bottom of the meniscus
   - slowly submerge the entire tip (all of the swabbing features) into the water, keep submerged for 5s, slowly withdraw
   - repeat for total of 10 swabs
   - measure the change in height of the water level, calculate total volume absorbed and average volume absorbed by each swab
   
   method #2 with water, wax paper/parafilm, microbalance (biology or chemistry labs should have one, some mechanical labs) [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JOp8rVTZRIyFNDBDuPVH94QhuYIPi7Vu/view)
   - crease the wax paper so water will sit in the middle
   - place the paper on the microbalance and add ~1ml of water. Tare the balance
   - Hold the swab horizontally above the water droplet.  Slowly lower the swab into the droplet of water and rotate 180 degrees in both directions, ensuring the swab is completely submerged into the droplet and stays submerged for 2 seconds then slowly raise the swab to remove it from the water
   - repeat for a total of 10 swabs
   - record the amount of water removed from the scale and calculate the amount abosorbed by each swab.

# Sample Collection Testing Procedures
1) with Methylene blue stain solution
   - do cheek swab (try to air out mouth and pick a less saliva-coated part of the cheek) or NP swab
   - smear onto a glass slide
   *if the smear doesn't result in any visible material left on the slide, place 50ul of buffer solution (saline, PBS, EPA water, etc) on the slide and roll the swab around in the buffer, dragging the liquid around the slide surface.

   - add 2 drops (~80ul) of methylene blue solution to the slide
   - cover with a cover slip and image
   - epithelial cells and bacteria should be visible under 4-10x magnification
